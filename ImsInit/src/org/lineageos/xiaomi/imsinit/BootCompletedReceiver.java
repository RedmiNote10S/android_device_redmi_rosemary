/*
 * WARNING: DIRTY HACK AHEAD
 * I have no idea why MTK's IMS does not work after a reboot on
 * SELinux enforcing. I have literally tried to put every service
 * with denial messages to permissive and the bug was still present.
 * But a global permissive environment fixes that magically.
 * Re-enabling Enhanced 4G manually also fixes the issue.
 * This is a dirty hack to toggle IMS off and back on again
 * on every boot other than the first boot. I figured this is
 * at least better than having to put the entire system on permissive.
 * But it is very dirty and can't be guaranteed to work.
 * We still need to figure out at some point why this happens.
